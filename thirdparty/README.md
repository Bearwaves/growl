## Modifications

This section lists modifications to third-party dependencies from their source.

### FreeType

Included only `src/` and `include/` directories, minus the `tools/` and `dlg/`
directories and `.mk` files.

### Harfbuzz

HarfBuzz is vendored because their CMake config is rubbish.

Only `src/` directory is included, with all non-C files removed (e.g. Python,
templates).

### libunibreak

Only the base C files (`unibreakbase.*`, `unibreakdef.*`), plus files needed for
linebreaks (`linebreak.*`, `linebreakdef.*`, `linebreakdata.c`) are included.

Generators, templates, emoji/word/grapheme data are not included.

### msdfgen

Included `core/`, `ext/`, `include/` and `lib/`, along with top-level headers
and license.

### SoLoud

Included `src/` (with exception of `src/c_api/`), `include/`, and license.

Added custom CMakeLists.txt.

### UTF8-CPP

Included only `source/` and `CMakeLists.txt`, along with license and README.
